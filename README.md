# ReservationKey_Usability_Enhancements

GreaseMonkey script for ReservationKey Usability Enhancements
With John's blessing, I am here to present to you a way to get some helpful new functionality into your ReservationKey, for FREE.  This is UNOFFICIAL so John is in no way responsible for it or supporting it.  I have developed them myself to meet my own needs, but thought the community could benefit from them as well.  I will be constantly updating them and responding to any needs that arise.

Here's a list of enhancements we have so far, and more are in the works.  You can opt in or out of using any of these, so you can decide to only use the ones that make sense for you and your business:

Force HTTPS - Make sure that ReservationKey is always running in a secure mode

Auto Reminders - Causes the reminders window pop-up automatically when something is due immediately

Double Payment Prevention - Pops up a confirmation dialog when you "Add Payment," "Charge Card," "Remove," or "Refund" to prevent accidental financial changes.  Additionally, it disables these buttons after you've clicked them, so you don't accidentally click twice and double charge the card.

Automatically Select Credit Card Type - Once you start typing the credit card number, the correct credit card type (Visa, Mastercard, Discover, American Express) will automatically be selected based on the card #.

COMING SOON:

Auto Refresh - Automatically refresh the calendar availability screen
History - Enable the use of the "Back" and "Forward" browser buttons

To start using these enhancements today, all you need to do is follow these simple instructions:
